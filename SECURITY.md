## Reporting a Vulnerability

GitHub. We will respond to your report within 5 business days.

Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

## Security Updates

We will issue security updates as needed. These updates will be documented in the release notes and will be available
through the usual channels (GitHub releases and the npm registry).

## Best Practices

To ensure the security of your application, we recommend the following best practices:

- Keep your dependencies up to date.
- Regularly audit your dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit`.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring your application and its dependencies.

## Contact

This is an open-source project, as such we do not have a dedicated security team. If you have any questions or concerns
regarding security, please contact us by creating an issue on GitHub.
